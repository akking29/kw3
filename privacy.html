            <p class="kw3-feature-subtitle team">The KW3 website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
           <p class="kw3-feature-subtitle team">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize KW3 pages, or register with KW3 site or services, a cookie helps KW3 to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same KW3 website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the KW3 features that you customized.</p>
           <p class="kw3-feature-subtitle team">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the KW3 services or websites you visit.</p>
            <h3 class="kw3-feature-title team" style="color: #333333;text-align: left;">Security of your Personal Information</h3>
            <p class="kw3-feature-subtitle team">KW3 secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. KW3 uses the following methods for this purpose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>SSL Protocol</span></li>
            </ul>
           <p class="kw3-feature-subtitle team">When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
           <p class="kw3-feature-subtitle team">We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
